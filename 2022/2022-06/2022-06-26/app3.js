# CHALLENGE

This method, which is supposed to return the result of dividing its first argument by its second, 
isn't always returning correct values. Fix it.

# EXAMPLE

solve(2, 1) // 2
solve(2, 4) // 0.5
solve(42, 0) // Infinity
solve(0, 8) // 0
solve(7, 2) // 3.5
solve(4.2, 1) // 4.2
solve(9999, 11) // 909

*/

// ANSWER

const solve = (x, y) => x / y
