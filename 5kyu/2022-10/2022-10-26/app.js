What's a Perfect Power anyway?
Tags: MATHEMATICS, FUNDAMENTALS

1. DESCRIPTION

A perfect power is a classification of positive integers:
In mathematics, a perfect power is a positive integer that can be expressed as an integer power of another positive integer. More formally, n is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers m > 1, and k > 1 such that mk = n.

Your task is to check wheter a given integer is a perfect power. If it is a perfect power, return a pair m and k with mk = n as a proof. Otherwise return Nothing, Nil, null, NULL, None or your language's equivalent.

Note: For a perfect power, there might be several pairs. For example 81 = 3^4 = 9^2, so (3,4) and (9,2) are valid solutions. However, the tests take care of this, so if a number is a perfect power, return any pair that proves it.


2. EXAMPLE

Test.describe("perfect powers", function(){
  Test.it("should work for some examples",function(){
    Test.assertSimilar(isPP(4), [2,2], "4 = 2^2");
    Test.assertSimilar(isPP(9), [3,2], "9 = 3^2");
    Test.assertEquals( isPP(5), null, "5 isn't a perfect number");
  });
});

*/

const isPP = function (n) {
  for (let m = 2; m * m <= n; m++)
    for (let k = 2, guess = m * m; guess <= n; k++, guess *= m)
      if (guess == n) return [m, k];
  return null;
};
